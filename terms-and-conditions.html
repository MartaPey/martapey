                    <h3>How I work:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To place an order, simply click the "Order a Commission" button, which will redirect you to a form where you can specify the details of your request, writing a description of it (you can atach images, sketches or other visual references to help me understand what you want).
                        </li>
                        <li>You will be contacted after I approve your commission request in order to review the details regarding prices and delivery dates.
                        </li>
                        <li>The final price will be established after an initial sketch has been defined, which will allow the commission work to begin. For any questions, please feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:martapey12@gmail.com" target="_blank">martapey12@gmail.com</a> </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>

                    <ol class="terms">
                        <li><b>General terms</b>

                                <li>I have the right to decline a piece if I feel uncomfortable.</li>
                                <li>Price may vary on complexity of character/pose/etc.</li>
                                <li>Commisions are NOT for commercial use. Personal use only. It'll come with a watermark that must not be removed.</li>
                                <li>Payment is via PayPal, Bizum or Bank transfer.</li>
                                <li>Commission payment can be done either 100% upfront or in two installments of 50% each (one before I start working and the other after the sketch has been approved).</li>
                                <li>If you do not have a visual reference for your character/s, there will be an extra charge (due to the difficulty of reading through descriptions and to get all of the fine details).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>I will send you pictures of the process, however, I must be informed of all changes you’d like me to make BEFORE I start the coloring process. Changes not related to coloring after that point will have an extra cost.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Full refunds are only available BEFORE I finish the initial sketch. Then, depending on the stage of the piece I am in, I will give an adequate partial refund.</li>
                                <li>The insatisfaction of the final piece does not warrant a refund, as the client has several instances throughout the process to voice any inconveniences they may have to prevent. </li>

                        </li>

                                <li>I may post your commission on my profile. If you do not wish for this to happen, please let me know before I finish the commission.</li>
